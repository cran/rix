Description: Simplifies the creation of reproducible development environments
    using the 'Nix' package manager. The included `rix()` function generates a
    complete description of the development environment as a `default.nix` file,
    which can then be built using 'Nix'. This results in project specific
    software environments with pinned versions of R, packages, linked system
    dependencies, and other tools. Additional helpers make it easy to run R code
    in 'Nix' software environments for testing and production.
